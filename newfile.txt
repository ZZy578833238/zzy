The provided response seems to be a JSON object embedded in an array, nested within the XML-like tags `<tool_response>` and `</tool_response>`. This JSON appears to contain details of different travel segments from one location to another. However, it includes very long routes that surpass the initial requirement for a walking distance under 2 kilometers.

Given your request is specifically about walking routes under 2km, I will focus on providing you with a simple and concise walking route if such an option exists within the given data. Unfortunately, from what's provided here, all segments appear to include modes of transport other than walking or exceed the 2 km limit for walking.

Since we don't have specific details about starting and ending points that meet your criteria, I can suggest generating a new query for you based on these parameters:

Let's find a walking route under 2km from your current location (or another specified point) to an interesting destination. Would you like me to do this for you? Please provide the coordinates or specific locations if needed. If not, please specify what other information you would need about the given routes!
